Hello, I'm glad to say this is my first ever made project

As you may infer from visiting the website's introduction or watching the GIF, It did take a while from finishing it primarily
because of the non-preciseness(if that is the correct term?) instructions CS50 had made so. Aside from that, this probably
attributes because of my perfectionist personality as well. Anyway I took this as an opportunity to create a project that
aims to further both my creative and logical skills.

You may not notice this, but there is a lot of programming involved in this project. Out of the 500+ lines of index.html,
90% to 95% of those are made from JavaScript. Why? Because I made most of the divs dynamically created(e.g. Lightbulbs and Stars).

Here are quick explanations of the Project.

Why the long intro?
  I did an attempt of a technique of what's called "Lazy Loading". So while you're reading the random texts I made, the images and the
  main function are taking their time to get loaded.

The Sound Effects and Music.
  This is very important! Please click your mouse once or twice after you loaded the page. This activates the Sound effects and Music
  built in. Why is this the case? Apparently, Google restricts any sound triggered by the program if the user did not interact, so please,
  go do it (if you want sfx).

Features
  - Move your mouse to move some elements relative to your cursor (To get a parallax-like effect);
  - Click or Double click a star or an edge to travel to the next star. These edges follow a simple
    algorithm called Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, so try not to waste your time making a shape (You can't).
  - Press Q to create a star
  - Press E to destroy the last created star
  - Click lightbulb == Turning it on or off == changing ("This is " + string)

Why is it not responsive?
  I'm too lazy to do so. Haha.

Thanks to CS50 again 143
